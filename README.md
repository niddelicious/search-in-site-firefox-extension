# search-in-site-firefox-extension
An extension for Firefox that takes the current selected text and inputs it into the sites own search field and submits it

This comes from a frustrating moment I had where I was on a site and wanted to search their catalog for an item in a bundle that wasn't linked on their bundle page, but I didn't want to highlight the text and Search on Google, nor copy it and scroll all the way to the top to enter it into the search field, as that would overwrite the primary copy I had in my clipboard. Similar extensions I found seemed to use the google "site:" functionality and still searching via google, but I wanted to use the site's internal search functionality.

So I took an opportunity to try and create an extension, for the exercise. And here we are.
